                    I don't have an actual normal kitkat with me at this moment,
                    but I can still tell you it's pretty alright. It's the baseline
                    for all the other kitkats, so it's not bad, but not mind blowing either.

                    This was the first kitkat I tried, and I was mostly confused. I guess that's fitting.
                    I shared this one with my girlfriend, and we both agreed that we had no clue what it was.
                    It had som purplish coloring on the inside, and it was a bit fruity. I think it may have been grape.

                        I'm writing this a while after I ate it, but I remember it being pretty good. It genuinely 
                        tasted 50% KitKat and 50% like one of those sweet biscuit cookies. I'd eat it again for sure.

                        I'm writing this a while after I ate it, but I vividly remember the flavor of this one. It was
                        like taking a bite of a lemon dessert. The flavor was adjacent to the Key Lime KitKat, one of 
                        my all time favorites, but it was a bit more sour. This one is really good, and I'd highly recommend it.

                        This kitkat tastes exactly like a chocolate orange. That means it tastes good and I would never turn it down,
                        but like, I would never go out of my way to get it because if I want to taste chocolate orange, I'll just get a chocolate orange.
