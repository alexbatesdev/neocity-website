                                I've redone the links page. I didn't like the "cool places airport" execution. It felt lazy
                                so I made a new version. Now it's "Link's links" and it's just a page with a bunch of pictures
                                of link, as well as links to the sites I find interesting and worth linking to. I honestly like
                                the *idea* of a cool places airport more than link's links, but I did a bad job of it before.
                                I may revisit the idea in the future, but for now I think this is a better execution.

                                I made a ton of updates today! These update logs aren't super serious, so this third log
                                is going to be used to summarize and talk about whatever else I want to talk about!!!
                                I actually forgot about a big part of the previous updates! A landing page!! Now this place 
                                feels like a *real* indie web website. The landing page has a webring, peoples buttons, my
                                button, and a button to enter the website, everything you could need! I've also done some
                                tweaks to the homepage and my upload script! In a last minute last minute update I've added
                                a guestbook via Dimden's atabook service!

                                Look at this insanity! Two updates in one day?? Unfortunately for anyone who regularly
                                checks up on this place, this update was almost all behind the scenes file organization.
                                I made it so every page is it's own folder, and that folder has css, js, and img folders
                                to store the respective files for a page. Before eveyr page img for every page was
                                stored in the same img folder, same thing with the other file types. Anyways, this made
                                me realize that my file uploading script isn't going to remove old/moved files so my
                                website is going to take up a ton of space with duplicate files until I fix that script.

                                New update to the homepage! I've felt like updating the more traditional website bits
                                recently, so I decided to fix the homepage a lil! The planet in the bottom right has
                                been kinda annoying with it in your face, so I moved it to the background! I also added
                                the sun and moon from soul eater, and all of these celestial bodies have parallax scroll
                                effect shenanigans! I think they make this place much livelier! I also just recently
                                finished reading Fire Force and Soul Eater, in my head I'm kinda imagining this like
                                unlocking an xbox 360 avatar item from a game via an achievement but my unlock is the
                                sun and moon on my site and my achievement was reading the manga!

                                worked a little bit on the <a href="/NekkoPlat/index.html">platformer</a>! That
                                platformer work has been spread out randomly over the last couple months, but I
                                am finally uploading it because today I cibe coded a new upload script that updates
                                my site whenever I push to github! The old one I had broke because I unsubscribed from
                                the nekoweb cute kitties tier, then when I came back there were rate limits added to the
                                ftp server, so my old script was too fast and would get rate limited. Anyways, with that
                                fixed I should be able to update the site more often!

                                First official update of the new year! I've been working on a platformer game/engine
                                that works entirely in HTML/CSS/JS! It's still super WIP, with only a tutorial room and
                                a debug room, but I think I've gotten it to the point that I can start making the rooms
                                I've been imagining in my head! I want this to be less of a game, and more of a way to
                                view my website in a different way! First I need to make a hub area, then I plan to make
                                rooms that correspond to the pages on my site that already exist. So like, the flipnote
                                still gallery will be an actual art museum you can walk around!

                                It's been unlisted and finished for a while, but I made an image ditherer! You can
                                find it <a href="/Ditherer/index.html">here</a>! It's a simple tool that lets you
                                pixelate an image! I made it because I wanted to mimmic the look of the Flipnote
                                Studio 3D Camera pixelation! I also added a link to the page in the left column!
                                Originally the page was orange and white, themed like flipnote, but I changed it
                                to a dark mode theme because I don't really like the color orange, and night mode
                                is easier to look at.

                                I've been hard at work since the last update! I've decided to try running NekkoStarr
                                like a AAA studio! That means I've cancelled the Daily Checkers service effective 10
                                minutes ago. Nobody used it, and it was a too buggy, slow, and hard to maintain due to
                                me not writing SOLID OOP code. That doesn't mean I've been twiddling my thumbs! I've
                                been hard at work on a total rewrite of the platformer hidden at the end of the maze!
                                I'm trying to make it so anyone can make levels for it using HMTL/CSS without knowing

                                It's been a while since an official update! I've been hard at work on both my school
                                work and some personal projects hidden on this here site! More on that when it's ready!
                                This update I've added a page for my <a href="/song_player/index.html">Song Player</a>
                                component! This lets you play music from a playlist of files! I made this to be easily

                                again with a slightly longer list! I like to start it at the beginning of class and see
                                how far it gets by the end.

                                then I kept working on it to share with the internet! The concept is simple: Checkers,
                                but you can only take 1 turn per day! It means you'll have to be... checking in daily!

                                I added a progress scroller/tracker to the sleepCD page! Now you can see how
                                long a track is, how far into it you are, and you can move to any part of the
                                track! I also added a fullscreen button on the ISS page, but that's mostly for
                                the raspberry pi I have hooked up to the ISS feed on my TV. I also scrambled
                                the layout of the homepage a bit, I think opening up the page for scrolling
                                gives me more freedom to add stuff.

                                lowered the resolution of the big images on this page for performance reasons.
                                I lowered the globe by way more than I needed to because it kinda looks vibey
                                crunched up like that. There's also a link to the <a href="/kitkat/">KitKat

                                I also reworked the second tab of this component. It used to be a ToDo, but I never
                                did anything on it so now the second tab is just a spot for thoughts.

                                are
                                less restrictions and more personality on nekoweb.org! I'm going to try to keep both

                                I want to make the page much more "aethetically in line" with the contents of
                                the CD.

                                also the beginnings of some new pages, but I haven't linked to them anywhere
                                yet.

                                I actually pushed these changes. I had reinstalled windows on my computer so I
                                didn't
                                have the neocities cli installed, and manually uploading everything sucks, then
                                I was
                                way too busy with school until now! I'm still busy, but I have enought time
                                today.

                                real ISS is! I also added some pieces to my Flipnote still gallery! I also also
                                changed
                                all my blinky buttons at the bottom of the page to be in a marquee!

                                This is a little update! I spontaneously got hyperfixated on space/NASA and set
                                up a 24/7 monitor in my living room to display a live feed from the ISS.
                                Unfortunately I could only view one camera feed at a time, and switching sucked.
                                This beings us to the update, I made a page <a href="ISS.html">here</a> that
                                displays the HD and SD ISS feeds, its location, and a feed of the Europa Clipper
                                being built! The page is super bare bones right now, but I plan to polish it up
                                and make it look pretty in the future!

                                This is a big update! The homepage has a ton more neocities flair and there's
                                more interconnecting happening on the site now! I also made a page to show off
                                drawings I made in Flipnote! You can find it <a href="/flipnoteStillGallery/">here</a>!
                                I also polished a bunch more random pages, so look at those if you'd like :)

                                I made an update and pushed it secretly! That was an accident lol! I made the
                                page, pushed changes, then I made the update message and forgot to push the new
                                changes. Anyways, check out the library or the update post below this for the
                                new stuff, also happy turkey day! 🦃

                                I randomly got on a mythBusters kick and decided to make a page for it! It's not
                                a shrine, but a random episode picker!
                                There's no reason to watch mythBusters in order, so this is a good way to pick a
                                random episode to watch.
                                You can find it <a href="/randomMythBustersEpisode/">here</a> or in the

                                cheat codes that aren't the Konami code? Maybe UDLR A UDLR B start?

                                Started the library page! Right now it's just a couple empty books and couple
                                not empty books. I plan to add more books and to redo the theming of the page. I
                                don't really think the space vibe works well, but it's the best I've got for
                                now. What I do really like about the library page is that you can open multiple
                                books at once, drag them around, flip pages, and close the books
