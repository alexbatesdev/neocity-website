                                It's been unlisted and finished for a while, but I made an image ditherer! You can
                                find it <a href="./Ditherer/index.html">here</a>! It's a simple tool that lets you
                                pixelate an image! I made it because I wanted to mimmic the look of the Flipnote
                                Studio 3D Camera pixelation! I also added a link to the page in the left column!
                                Originally the page was orange and white, themed like flipnote, but I changed it
                                to a dark mode theme because I don't really like the color orange, and night mode
                                is easier to look at.

                                I've been hard at work since the last update! I've decided to try running NekkoStarr
                                like a AAA studio! That means I've cancelled the Daily Checkers service effective 10
                                minutes ago. Nobody used it, and it was a too buggy, slow, and hard to maintain due to
                                me not writing SOLID OOP code. That doesn't mean I've been twiddling my thumbs! I've
                                been hard at work on a total rewrite of the platformer hidden at the end of the maze!
                                I'm trying to make it so anyone can make levels for it using HMTL/CSS without knowing
                                javascript!

                                It's been a while since an official update! I've been hard at work on both my school
                                work and some personal projects hidden on this here site! More on that when it's ready!
                                This update I've added a page for my <a href="./song_player/index.html">Song Player</a>
                                component! This lets you play music from a playlist of files! I made this to be easily

                                Added a same day second update that makes the background a random image from tetris for
                                the sega genesis, as well as the page having some more instruction on how to use it!

                                self. It does the worst sorting algorithm on a list, then when it finishes it does it
                                again with a slightly longer list! I like to start it at the beginning of class and see
                                how far it gets by the end.

                                I finally finished <a href="./daily-checkers-frontend/index.html">The Daily Checkers</a>
                                and added it to the homepage! I'm really proud of it. It started as a school project,
                                then I kept working on it to share with the internet! The concept is simple: Checkers,
                                but you can only take 1 turn per day! It means you'll have to be... checking in daily!

                                "number go up" dopamine. :) Is the view counter page specific? IF it is I might slap a

                                don't think many people are actually going to read this or go to the page.

                                I added a progress scroller/tracker to the sleepCD page! Now you can see how
                                long a track is, how far into it you are, and you can move to any part of the
                                track! I also added a fullscreen button on the ISS page, but that's mostly for
                                the raspberry pi I have hooked up to the ISS feed on my TV. I also scrambled
                                the layout of the homepage a bit, I think opening up the page for scrolling
                                gives me more freedom to add stuff.

                                lowered the resolution of the big images on this page for performance reasons.
                                I lowered the globe by way more than I needed to because it kinda looks vibey

                                that I use on my home media PC, and I added a page that's just a maze in the dark.
                                I'll integrate the maze into the site, but for now you can find it <a

                                I added customization to the sitebox on nekoweb, as well as updating some username
                                stuff! I also joined a nekoweb webring! I think that might be broken on neocities.
                                I also reworked the second tab of this component. It used to be a ToDo, but I never
                                did anything on it so now the second tab is just a spot for thoughts.

                                are
                                less restrictions and more personality on nekoweb.org! I'm going to try to keep both
                                updated for the time being, but I might forget to update one or the other sometimes.

                                I added a new page! This is a page for my childhood Sleep CD! I think you
                                could consider this a shrine, but I made it more for preservation than anything.
                                You can listen to the whole CD and read my thoughts on each track <a

                                moment.
                                I want to make the page much more "aethetically in line" with the contents of
                                the CD.
                                Oh I also added some dancing cats to the homepage!

                                up a 24/7 monitor in my living room to display a live feed from the ISS.
                                Unfortunately I could only view one camera feed at a time, and switching sucked.
                                This beings us to the update, I made a page <a href="ISS.html">here</a> that
                                displays the HD and SD ISS feeds, its location, and a feed of the Europa Clipper
                                being built! The page is super bare bones right now, but I plan to polish it up
                                and make it look pretty in the future!
