                                I added a view counter to the homepage so that visiting/working on my site can give me
                                "number go up" dopamine. :) Is the view counter page specific? IF it is I might slap a

                                I added to the <a href="https://nekkostarr.nekoweb.org/DarknessMaze/">Darkness Maze</a>!
                                and now it has a platformer at the end! I generally want that to be a surprise, but I
                                don't think many people are actually going to read this or go to the page.

                                I added a progress scroller/tracker to the sleepCD page! Now you can see how
                                long a track is, how far into it you are, and you can move to any part of the
                                track! I also added a fullscreen button on the ISS page, but that's mostly for
                                the raspberry pi I have hooked up to the ISS feed on my TV. I also scrambled
                                the layout of the homepage a bit, I think opening up the page for scrolling
                                gives me more freedom to add stuff.

                                I added a last.fm tracker to the site! It's really simple, and if you're reading
                                this you likely already know that since it's right above this text! I also
                                lowered the resolution of the big images on this page for performance reasons.
                                I lowered the globe by way more than I needed to because it kinda looks vibey
                                crunched up like that. There's also a link to the <a href="kitkat.html">KitKat

                                I added some unrelated web projects to the site! I added my personal homepage
                                that I use on my home media PC, and I added a page that's just a maze in the dark.
                                I'll integrate the maze into the site, but for now you can find it <a
                                    href="https://nekkostarr.nekoweb.org/DarknessMaze/">here</a>!

                                use it though

                                I added customization to the sitebox on nekoweb, as well as updating some username
                                stuff! I also joined a nekoweb webring! I think that might be broken on neocities.
                                I also reworked the second tab of this component. It used to be a ToDo, but I never
                                did anything on it so now the second tab is just a spot for thoughts.

                                I added a cool links page! It's called the <a href="cool-places.html">Cool Places
                                    Airport</a>! It's a page for me to share links to cool sites and thingsies! You
                                can find it over there on earth! I also moved my site over to <a
                                    href="https://lilystarr.nekoweb.org/index.html">nekoweb.org</a>! They seem
                                pretty
                                cool, and I want to support every small web revival I can! Right now it's easier to
                                update my site on neocities because I have the neocities cli installed, but there
                                are
                                less restrictions and more personality on nekoweb.org! I'm going to try to keep both
                                updated for the time being, but I might forget to update one or the other sometimes.
                                This update technically also pushed a new unfinished page, but I doubt you'll find
                                it :)

                                I added a new page! This is a page for my childhood Sleep CD! I think you
                                could consider this a shrine, but I made it more for preservation than anything.
                                You can listen to the whole CD and read my thoughts on each track <a
                                    href="/SleepCD.html">here</a>!
                                The CD means a lot to me, but the page is bare minimum presentable to me at the
                                moment.
                                I want to make the page much more "aethetically in line" with the contents of
                                the CD.
                                Oh I also added some dancing cats to the homepage!

                                I just finished upgrading the ISS page. Now it has a title and little blurb,
                                as well as a back button and a button to toggle all the new stuff. There are
                                also the beginnings of some new pages, but I haven't linked to them anywhere
                                yet.

                                I actually pushed these changes. I had reinstalled windows on my computer so I

                                have the neocities cli installed, and manually uploading everything sucks, then
                                I was
                                way too busy with school until now! I'm still busy, but I have enought time

                                changed
                                all my blinky buttons at the bottom of the page to be in a marquee!

                                This is a little update! I spontaneously got hyperfixated on space/NASA and set
                                up a 24/7 monitor in my living room to display a live feed from the ISS.
                                Unfortunately I could only view one camera feed at a time, and switching sucked.
                                This beings us to the update, I made a page <a href="ISS.html">here</a> that
                                displays the HD and SD ISS feeds, its location, and a feed of the Europa Clipper
                                being built! The page is super bare bones right now, but I plan to polish it up
                                and make it look pretty in the future!

                                This is a big update! The homepage has a ton more neocities flair and there's
                                more interconnecting happening on the site now! I also made a page to show off
                                drawings I made in Flipnote! You can find it <a href="/flipnote.html">here</a>!

                                I randomly got on a mythBusters kick and decided to make a page for it! It's not
                                a shrine, but a random episode picker!
                                There's no reason to watch mythBusters in order, so this is a good way to pick a
                                random episode to watch.
                                You can find it <a href="/RandomMythBustersEpisode.html">here</a> or in the

                                cheat codes that aren't the Konami code? Maybe UDLR A UDLR B start?

                                Started the library page! Right now it's just a couple empty books and couple
                                not empty books. I plan to add more books and to redo the theming of the page. I
                                don't really think the space vibe works well, but it's the best I've got for
                                now. What I do really like about the library page is that you can open multiple
                                books at once, drag them around, flip pages, and close the books

                            Recently I've been hyperfixated on speedrun world record histories.
                            It's absolutely fascinating how these records evolve. The Ultrakill
                            speedruns and Mario Kart histories are wild! <br />
